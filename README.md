# EvolutionStrategies
Evolutionary machine learning algorithm for optimizing the weights on a feed forward network.
Requires a feed forward network implementation for the evaluate method (determining the performance 
of each individual chromosome by creating a feed forward network based on the weights and returning the 
test set performance of the network).
